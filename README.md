The first real 42 course project. Initially we needed to write a library of C functions from some standart libraries. 

But the version shown here is my own and the one I use for further C projects on the 42 course. It constantly evolves because I just add there every new function I creaste and find generally useful.

You will not validate your libft by copying this version. But what you could get out of it is the structure, the manner of doing Makefiles and maybe some functions logic.
